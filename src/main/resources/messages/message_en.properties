#info
MemberInfo=BLACKPINK adds the meaning of denying pink, which is expressed in the prettiest color, as black, and contains a twist of [Don't just look pretty] and [What you see is not everything]. There are also many songs that match the meaning of the team name. BLACKPINK's second full-length album [BORN PINK] was released last August. BLACKPINK, who declared the queen's return by pouring out the best, first, and shortest records upon the release of their new song, will once again captivate listeners around the world.
